MSSPE (Metagenomic Sequencing with Spiked Primer Enrichment) Design Software v2.0

Last updated 10/23/19 Charles Chiu

Overview: This is a shell script that takes as input a multiple-sequenced aligned (MSA) FASTA file of reference sequences
and designs short primer sets (generally 11-17 nt) tiled across the entire sequence space, for use in the MSSPE protocol.

The MSSPE protocol has been published in Deng, et al., (2019) in the journal Nature Microbiology.

v1.0 - uses legacy BLASTALL (software used for the Deng, et al. 2019 paper)

This software has been tested in an Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS Linux environment.

Main script:
MSSPE-design.sh [OBFUSCATED]

Usage: MSSPE-design.sh <MSA FASTA file> <kmer size> <segment_window> <overlap> <selection_window> <evalue> <dG> <dS> <numcores>

*********************************************************************************************************************************
MSA FASTA file = multiple-sequenced aligned FASTA file
kmer size = kmer size (generally 11 - 17 nt)
segment_window = designated bp interval between forward and primer spiked primers (300-600 nt)
overlap = overlap in the tiled fragment windows (1/2 of the fragment window size, or 150-300 nt)
selection_window = size of window in bp from which forward and reverse primers will be selected (50 nt)
evalue = evalue for comparing forward and reverse primers by BLASTN (generally 0.1)
dG = "delta G", primer energy threshold cutoff in cals/mol (generally -9000)
dS = "delta S", cutoff for the number of minimum segments that need to be covered by each new primer (generally 0-10, depending
   on the number, diversity, and breadth of reference sequeces
